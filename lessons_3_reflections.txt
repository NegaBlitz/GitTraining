When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

For collaboration and in case you need backups.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It can cause nasty conflicts with other people committing at the same time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Branches are stored locally, forks are stored online, and clones are pulled from online to local and are not different.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It helps if, again, an unintentional mistake was made, so there is a state to fall back on.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Dropbox is a possibility. It'd be harder to work together simultaneously or offline but faster and easier to sync everyone together.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

You'd want to do potentially breaking changes or experimental things in a branch while master should be reserved for things that are going to need to be changed for sure.
